Rules for creation of the worldbuilder tool.

The worldbuilder tool will act as an easy way to create concrete classes of 
objects and spaces. It will do auto code generation. Some rules ought to be
put in place for how this code will be generated. 

Naming Conventions:
Any object will need a name and a surname. Its surname will be either the
space in which it exists or its parent class, whichever makes it unique with
the preference given to space.

File Location:
Objects will be grouped by surname for organization. An added index file
will accompany the system to aid searching operations which needs to be changed
on generation of a new class.
